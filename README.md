# wt98999_by_Seppppx_defconfig
A custom defconfig for compiling a kernel for the Lenovo Phab 2.

The full kernel source code is available here 
https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/sk/en/products/tablets/phab-series/phab2/downloads/ds118503

This defconfig adds support for modules. Has added cifs support and I might add some more features if there is any interest in this.
